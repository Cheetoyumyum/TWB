# Or find it in your Twitch Developer Console
# This enables the redemption poller as a fallback if webhooks aren't working
TWITCH_CHANNEL_USER_ID=your_channel_user_id_here

# Webhook Secret (for EventSub verification)
# Generate a random secret for webhook verification
# On Windows PowerShell: -join ((65..90) + (97..122) + (48..57) | Get-Random -Count 32 | % {[char]$_})
# On Linux/Mac: openssl rand -hex 16
# This is only needed if you want to set up webhooks

# ============================================
# OPTIONAL - Advanced Settings
# ============================================
